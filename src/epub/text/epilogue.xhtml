			<h2 epub:type="title">The Epilogue to the Reader</h2>
			<p>By this poetical description, you may perceive, that my ambition is not onely to be Empress, but authoress of a whole world; and that the worlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other philosophical world, mentioned in the first part of this description, are framed and composed of the most pure, that is, the rational parts of matter, which are the parts of my mind; which creation was more easily and suddenly effected, than the conquests of the two famous monarchs of the world. Alexander and Cesar. Neither have I made such disturbances, and caused so many dissolutions of particulars, otherwise named deaths, as they did; for I have destroyed but some few men in a little boat, which dyed through the extremity of cold, and that by the hand of justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a young and beauteous lady. And in the formation of those worlds, I take more delight and glory, then ever Alexander or Cesar did in conquering this terrestrial world; and though I have made my Blazing-World a peaceable world, allowing it but one religion, one language, and one government; yet could I make another world, as full of factions, divisions and warrs, as this is of peace and tranquility; and the rational figures of my mind might express as much courage to fight, as Hector and Achilles had; and be as wise as Nestor, as; eloquent as Ulysses, and be as beautiful as Hellen. But I esteeming peace before warr, wit before policy, honesty before beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen,Â etc. chose rather the figure of honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all this terrestrial world; and if any should like the world I have made, and be willing to be my subjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean in their minds, fancies or imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be subjects, they may create worlds of their own, and govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for, concerning the philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-World, it having an Empress already, who rules it with great wisdom and conduct, which Empress is my dear platonick friend; I shall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her government, much less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any other, but rather choose to create another world for another friend.</p>
